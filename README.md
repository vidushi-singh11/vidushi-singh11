🚀 About Me

🎓 I’m Vidushi Singh, a pre-final year B.Tech CSE student with a strong interest in Web Development, Machine Learning, and Data Analytics.
💻 I work on building scalable web applications and experimenting with data-driven solutions that solve real-world problems.
🌱 Currently exploring API development and integration, creating interactive dashboards in Power BI, and sharpening my DSA problem-solving skills for optimized performance.
🤝 Open to collaborating on full-stack projects, machine learning models, and data visualization solutions that deliver impact.
📚 And , if its something outside the tech world, you can find me immersed in the world of literature — reading novels, writing, and exploring storytelling.
